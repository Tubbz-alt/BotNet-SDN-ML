# Datasets

This folder contains the dataset used to train and test the neural networks.

The dataset has been derived from the [Hogzilla dataset](http://ids-hogzilla.org/dataset/) by considering a subset of features that can be extracted in a SDN using OpenFlow calls.

The *Fair_Dataset* contains exactly the same number of normal and botnet traffic samples. 
The *TrainSet* and *TestSet* files contain (train,test) dataset pairs randomly extracted from the fair dataset (with a 80%/20% proportion).
